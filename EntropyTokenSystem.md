Token system is really DAO part one. It explains how the token works, what it represents, how is it obtained, what rights it gives to it’s holders, how it is transferred, how and why it circulates around the sytem. 

We briefly discussed a Two token system in which contributors don’t have to have money, but they still can participate, but because to start Entropy one needs ethers, there are also backers. Backers can’t have special voting rights or special access rights, because it would be prioritising people who can spare more ether, but they do have to have some special rights, because otherwise why they would even donate any ether. If they want to buy Entropy tokens to speculate, it’s fine, but in this case you would need to explain to them why this project is sustainable, and why these tokens will be valuable, without promising a RoI and without being regulated as an investment vehicle. 

Let's get clear on what token does: how is it issued, how it is issued at the start and whether there is emission later, what rights it gives to it's holders, how it transferred, how it circulates, what it represents etc. 

I have some questions:
If any contributor has a right to vote:
* Who defines what is a quality of contribution allowing someone to vote on proposals
* Let’s say anyone can vote on the destination - what is so special in becoming a voter then?
* How do you KYC contributors? It’s not going to be a problem if each member of the crew, or a guardian can remember contributors and vouch for them.

##Some thoughts on Roles. Probably should be moved into Roles of The Participants section.

Backers are people who give ether and they get tokens in proportion to the amount of ether
Backers don’t have more votes than others to prevent money based power. If they don’t have more votes, what, apart from speculating their tokens, is their incentive to actually donate any Ether at all?
* May be they can advertise their shit? 
In this case physical fancy floating solar wind powered hack space should exist, because it is a cool place to advertise your shit. The shit advertised should be also cool, it can’t be something super boring.
Projects are stuff that happend in the hackspace. They are basically the first contributors that can use the infrastructure to build their projects. 


Crew - core team, guardians - people who called the shots and are responsible for all this thing to work out. They have to be trusted a little, but the contributors and the backers can also get rid of them. The project need leadership but no central authority. How do you tell contributors from the core team? Contributors are involved and the crew is comitted. The Pig and The Chicken decide to open a bar. And they serve eggs and bacon for breakfast, The Chicken is involved and The Pig is committed. 
Crew that is actually responsible for the physical boat to go places, not to the bottom of the sea know what they’re doing. Crew that can be also responsible for less scary things, like questions which are not life and death questions. But may be then they are contributors too? But what makes them different from contributors who just contributed a little bit, like tweeted something nice about Entrpy?
I think this has to be defined soehow, otherwise people who contribute a lot but don’t brag about it, or are slower but contribute something of quality and usefulness will be treated unfairly. May be it’s not the point to make it fair at all, but that might result in general disengagement of everyone except speculators cuz they have a different interest.
