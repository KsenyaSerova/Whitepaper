# Project Entropy - Whitepaper

Intro: Entropy is a bunch of boats that people who don't have boats can use to travel and to hangout.

Boats are maintained by people who hangout on them.

And sailed by people who can sail them with other people on them safely.

Where they sail and what they do \(and why they do it\) is decided by people on the boats, and everyone who helped so far.
