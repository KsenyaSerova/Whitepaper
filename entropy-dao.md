### The Entropy DAO

People can use our DAO to say where the project should go, what it should do and which other projects or ideas it should help.

To become a member of the DAO you need to be a contributor to the project. This can happen by either helping us out to build the platform \(e.g. successful Github commits\) or contributing financially by obtaining the issued Entropy Token for Ethereum.
